       "'If you were hypothetically in Sean “Diddy” Combs’ situation where you need to flee the country due to criminal activity and had to only use crypto to store assets how would you do it most easily without getting flagged? \\nI am just absolutely flabbergasted by the Diddy situation as he fled the country amidst a sex trafficking investigation. He’s on the run and I’ve never seen a high profile celebrity pull something off where they escape prior to Feds raiding homes. Seems like something only possible in movies. I know no one would ever just use crypto if they needed to escape and would probably have many other tools at their disposal especially at his level of wealth. However, I’m genuinely curious if you were tasked to only use crypto as a vector to hide assets how would that work? Would a person need to create a fake identity to cash out the assets on an exchange? Do you just move money on to a wallet and have other people slowly sell assets for you? Is there a monetary limit where companies like Trezor or Ledger would flag you or freeze your funds if the government wanted to freeze your assets? Is Monero inherently the best for a criminal to use since it can’t be traced? \\n\\nUpdate: He didn’t see them coming he’s still in the country as of right now lol'"
