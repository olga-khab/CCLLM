Put that guy in front of enough people and you will get widespread adoption. But I also listened to the Peter Schiff debate with Raoul Pal on Bitcoin on the Impact Theory podcast. I used to listen to Peter Schiff years ago when I was a permabear, but I stopped when I realized you don’t make money as a permabear, it’s the quickest way to stay poor. Then I watched the Cathie Wood interview on Schwab live and I thought she really deflected when the interviewer challenged her about whether Bitcoin was a “risk on” or “risk off” bet. She said it was both, but didn’t really back it up. What’d I’d like to see is if Bitcoin’s correlation to other risk assets like tech stocks and altcoins breaks. I haven’t looked that closely but I suspect it is correlated quite closely. So if you’re asking for the a bear case for Bitcoin it’s if the market takes a dump, there is a good chance Bitcoin goes down even more. I think if you take a step back, there are clearly two narratives for Bitcoin here. One is the Bitcoin maximalist narrative, which is this is the advent of digital gold, superior to real gold, and a revolutionary new way to store wealth in cyberspace in the face of unprecedented fiat debasement. The other narrative is a lot more simple. Bitcoin is a new asset class that allows speculators to trade volatility. Full stop. You’ll see the lows again the minute we fall into a recession if that’s the case. I guess as I type this, it really could be both. The only thing stopping me from going all in is I can’t tell long term which narrative will prevail.',\n",

       " \"I've been in crypto since 2011 and learned more than a few things on each bull run. The top is usually harder to find than the bottom, because we're in completely uncharted territory each time and it's a matter of not running out of steam. I pre-calculate the top as we go through each bull run, and re-calculate as we progress through it. Based on previous bull runs (compare the charts logarithmically), this cycle we should land somewhere between $150k and $400k between November and December of this year. That said, the ETFs created a supply squeeze before the halving, so we may peak early. Or the bull run may carry on longer if retail investors keep buying for longer because more rich boomers can now buy it through their normal brokers. Time will tell, but read the charts. Watch for trading volume, supply vs demand (if whales and retail investors are still buying more than can be mined in a day), and for general market exhaustion. Any leg of the bull run (multiple consecutive large green candles) is expected to eventually run out of steam, and pull back for a few days or a week for a sanity check before pushing forward. Again, overlap this bull run with previous bull runs and see if we're accelerating faster or farther than we have before. The ETFs made us accelerate *sooner* than before, but not necessarily faster and definitely not farther yet. If we get close to marks set in previous runs, odds are pretty good that we're at/near the top and it's time to start taking profits. Also note that the last bull run got cut short due to rates being raised, so the two previous runs are better measures chart-wise. Keep an eye on the Bitcoin rainbow chart and let it help guide you. We're just getting started this cycle.  Here's some additional context of where we're at compared to previous cycles. We're ahead of the curve because of the ETFs, but still have 6-8 months to go before the expected peak. \",\n",

So many events require certain apps to be downloaded that you will never use again, so people will still download whatever app is needed to use the tickets.
